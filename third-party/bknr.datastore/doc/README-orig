BKNR CODENAME: SPUTNIK

1. Introduction

BKNR is a software launch platform for LISP satellites. You could
replace ``launch platform'' with framework and ``satellites'' with
``applications'', but that would be too many buzzwords.

BKNR is made of facilities that are not very useful on their own, but
they can be used to quickly build shiny and elegant LISP
satellites. For example, a very important component of BKNR is its
datastore, which brings persistence to CLOS in a very simple way. By
adding a few declarations to your class definitions, you can have
persistent objects. You can also add XML import/export to your objects
in a similar way. I think this is the single most attractive feature
of BKNR: no more mapping from a relational database to LISP objects,
no more XML parsing and XML generation, you just write plain
application code.

2. Installation

BKNR has been developed with CMUCL 19a under FreeBSD, and has been
tested with Allegro Common Lisp 6.2 under Windows and Freebsd. Install
the BKNR sourcecode and the thirdparty sourcecode.

Then configure the pathnames in bknr/init.lisp, and load
bknr/init.lisp. Afterwards, you can use ASDF to load the BKNR
facilities.

To load the BKNR indices facility:
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bknr-indices)

To load the BKNR datastore facility:
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bknr-indices)

To load the BKNR impex facility:
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bknr-indices)

To load the BKNR framework:
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bknr)

3. Further documentation

You can read the BKNR manual in bknr/doc/ . You can also browse the
sourcecode for the tutorials in bknr/src/indices/tutorial.lisp,
bknr/src/data/tutorial.lisp and bknr/src/xml-impex/tutorial.lisp.
