# Screenshotbot: Screenshot Testing Service

Screenshotbot is a Screenshot Testing service. Screenshotbot will
connect your existing Android, iOS or Selenium tests to track how
screenshots change over time, notifying you on Pull Requests, Jira
etc. We provide several integrations to common Code Review and Task
Management platforms, and have more in the pipeline.

Screenshotbot provides an Open Source alternative to various other
tools already on the market (Applitools, Percy, Happo etc.) It powers
our own commercial platform
[screenshotbot.io](https://screenshotbot.io).

Unlike the other tools mentioned, this open source library does not
provide browser test runner. There are better open source tools to run
Selenium or Cypress tests and generate screenshots. Screenshotbot just
expects you to use these tools to generate a directory of screenshots,
and we'll handle the rest.
